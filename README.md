# Pattern_Recognition

This project used **MATLAB** to conduct pattern recognition on cryptography.

You can download MATLAB from [this website](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html).


> Acknowledgement: Yidong Chong (NTU, Singapore) suggested this exercise as an excellent introduction to the power of markov chains and probabilistic modeling. The algorithm used in this exercise is from Chapter 1 of the article “The Markov Chain Monte Carlo Revolution” by Persi Diaconis.
